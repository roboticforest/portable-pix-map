# A Quick Hack

This is a very low priority project for me right now. I may or may not ever finish this little utility.

I hastily wrote this code to process frames I extracted from a video for a university art class. The code did exactly what it needed to do and got set aside. I've worked a little on this since then, but it's not high on my list.
