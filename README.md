# A Quick and Dirty Start

This project will be a library for loading and saving Portable Pixmap (PPM) files, but I need it in a hurry for an unrelated university art project due Nov 23rd, 2020.

I've been wanting to make this library for at least a year now and intend to finish it, but for now I'm going to rush through getting the basics needed for my task and try to come back later.
